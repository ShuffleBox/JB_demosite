        <h2> About </h2>
        <p>This site is a sandbox project to try out <a href="https://openai.com/blog/whisper/">Whisper by OpenAI</a>.
           Whisper is a machine learning powered speech to text engine that is fairly easy to use and impressively accurate.
           In order to make learning a new thing "stick", IMO, it's always best to wrap it in something personal if you can.
           For example: "I'm going to learn how to build an app." works better when you have a goal you care about.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whisper outputs in TXT (no time codes), SRT (SubRip subtitle format), and VTT (video text track) formats.  
          The VTT files can be used with audio/video players to give you a live close caption 
          or live transcript that follows along as it plays.  This demo site uses <a href="https://ableplayer.github.io/ableplayer/">AblePlayer</a>. 
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Note:</strong> Content presented was batch processed while I had temporary access to an Nvidia 3090 and leveraged the "large"
          model with Whisper.  Files can be processed with CPU only, but takes hours instead of minutes to process one show.  Automating the processing
          of new episodes is something I'm interested in, but gets a bit outside of the scope of the original "learning whisper" goal and is a version 
          2.0 type of feature.  I also figured it's worth throwing this over the fence to the community just in case it's something that others more familiar
          with JB content would want to look into.
